  – & – & Eybler likely revised \A1 at a later point in time, which is evident from different ink colors (initial version \A1a: lighter color; revision \A1b: darker color). Moreover, \B1 was copied from the initial version (or a copy of it).
      Obvious mistakes in \B1 have note been indicated here. \\

    & 58   & –      & \A1a ended with a \halfNoteDotted\ in ob and a \quarterNote\ in the other parts. In \A1b, Eybler shortened the 3rd \quarterNote\ to an \eighthNote\, added a fermata to the rest at the end of the bar, and cancelled the subsequent full measure rest. Notebly, he did not correct the number of bars at the end of the movement (which still reads “100”). \\
